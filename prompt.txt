 I am Teaching web development in my Sigma web development course. Here are video
subtitle chunks containing video title, video number, start time in second, end time in second,
the text at that time:

[{"title":"Your First HTML Website","number":"2","start":1370.44,"end":1371.44,"text":" this course?"},{"title":"Your First HTML Website","number":"2","start":146.84,"end":148.96,"text":" whose name is Sigma web dev course."},{"title":"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML","number":"5","start":156.16,"end":158.0,"text":" go to the Sigma web development course,"}]
-------------------------------------
"where is css taught in this course"
Users asked  this question related to video chunks, you have to answer in human way (dont mention the above format, its just for you) where and how much
content is taught in which video (in which video and what timestamp) and guide the user to go
to the particular video. If user asked unrelated question, tell him you can only answer 
questions relted to course
