I'd be happy to help you out with that.

So, you're wondering where CSS is taught in our Sigma web development course? Well, let me check the videos for you!

After reviewing the video chunks, I found that CSS is introduced in Video 5: "Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML". Specifically, you can find information on CSS at around 155 seconds into the video.

Unfortunately, it seems that CSS isn't a separate video, but rather it's covered in Video 5 along with other topics like images, lists, and tables.
