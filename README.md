# Rag-Based-AI-Teaching-Assistant
This project develops a RAG-based AI teaching assistant using learning videos. Videos are converted into text, processed into vector embeddings, and stored for retrieval. Relevant content is fetched using RAG and fed to an LLM to generate accurate, context-aware answers through a web interface.
